Feel free to contribute in any of the ways outlined:

- Request features
- Submit bug reports
- Submit pull requests
- Help by answering issues
- Tell us if you are using the plugin in your project (it helps!)

Just a few guidelines (for now):

- Follow the existing conventions (if unsure, make an issue)
- Ensure dist and js/css dirs are kept uptodate with each other
- Minify using https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home (no custom options)
